# 《采石》
## --我素牛顿

被切割的石头  
被切割的时候  
望向使它被切割的被切割的人  
被切割的时代 被切割的我  
奔向构成的旅程  
继续走向未知的远方  

切割后沉默  
天然的自由  
成为阶梯后  
无助的停留在原地  
时代的脚步踏过我  
只留下一地尘埃  
上方脚印密布  
尘埃遮蔽了我的眼睛  
前方乌云密布  

无人歌颂无人知道的可怜石头  
这遍地尘埃就是你来过的痕迹  
同胞无数灵魂  
祝此时代前进的号角  
无人歌颂无人知道的可怜石头  
开采你的时候可曾想过  
他们自己可否是一块可怜的石头  
切割你的时候是否想过  
自己也变成了沉默的阶梯  

人们在俯视雕像的时候可曾想过  
基座上石头是最初的起点  

人们在俯视雕像的时候可曾想过  
基座上小小的石头无人关注未曾怨言  


在被切割过的时代  
石头们从深山中走来  
向未知的未来奔去  
一个个化作尘埃  
尘埃中有对未来的向往  
石而成为雕像  
石而成为基座  

雕像在俯瞰人们的时候可曾想过  
没有脚下的石头  
也没有这雕像的开始  

雕像们高高在上可曾想过  
体内的石英  
是我同胞粉碎的脊梁  

铭记这时代的阶梯  
被我们踩踏这阶梯  
亿万块粉碎的脊梁  
撑起时代前进的泡影  

新生的石头从山中运来  
听到雷鸣隐隐  
交织爆破  
灵魂在山口又回顾

# 《Stone quarrying》  
## （Cai Shi）
## by WoSuNiudun

When being cut,  
The stone looks up at the cutter—also cut,  
In this cut era, I, too, am cut.  
Embarking on a journey of formation,  
I keep moving toward the unknown distance.  

After being cut, it falls silent.    
Its natural freedom,  
Once turned into a step,  
Helplessly stays in place.  
The footsteps of the era trample over me,  
Leaving nothing but a layer of dust.  
Footprints cover the ground above,  
Dust blinds my eyes,  
And dark clouds gather ahead.  

Poor stones, uncelebrated and unknown—  
This widespread dust is the trace that proves you were here.  
Countless souls of my kin,  
Herald the advance of this era.  
Poor stones, uncelebrated and unknown—  
When they mined you, did they ever think:  
Could they themselves be a poor stone?  
When they cut you, did they ever realize:  
They would also become silent steps?  

When people look down at the statues, do they ever think:  
The stones on the base are the original starting point?  

When people look down at the statues, do they ever think:  
The tiny stones on the base, unnoticed, never complained?  

In this cut era,  
Stones come from deep mountains,  
Marching toward an unknown future.  
One by one, they turn to dust—   
Yet in the dust, there lies longing for the future.  
Some stones become statues,  
Others become bases.  

When the statues overlook the people, do they ever think:  
Without the stones beneath their feet,  
There would be no beginning for these statues?  

When the statues stand high above, do they jever know:  
The quartz within them,  
Is the shattered backbone of my kin?  

Remember these steps of the era—  
The steps we trample on.  
Hundreds of millions of shattered backbones,  
Prop up the illusory bubble of the era’s progress.  

New stones are transported from the mountains.  
The faint rumble of thunder is heard,  
Mixed with the sound of explosions.  
At the mountain pass, souls look back again.
